This week, I made a separate branch addressing a data structures challenge on inverting binary trees.  I had problems with the first one 
I made as it had the commit history of the other branch my group was working on so I had to make another pull request after
rebasing onto the master branch before working on my branch.  Now, I am waiting.  As for the branch on our own challenge 
regarding checking if a tree is a binary search tree, I do not know if it is fixable as there seems to be a problem with
our implementation of building the tree.  We will continue to look at it.
