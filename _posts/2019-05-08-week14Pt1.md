On 05/08/19, I went to the Careers in Open Source Event held by Patrick Masson and the OSI's Board of Directors.  I liked how they 
addressed the audience's questions so that people of varying experience in open source were encouraged to ask.  I liked how they 
encouraged anyone of any capability to start contributing to open source.

I was once again exposed to the notion of favoring copyleft licenses to spread free software.  Instead of putting the software into public domain which
can expose it to potential middlemen who decide to make it a proprietary software for instance, copyleft licenses enable people to exercise
freedom in modifying the code or simply redistributing it the way it is.  The right to further edit and such is a passed favorable concept.

What I found kind of unexpected that is not uniquely associated to open source was when a person from the audience was told to 
stop talking further about his idea of certifications and how beneficial they are to one's development and prospects.  He was 
told to stop for it was not directly related to open source and it was not "his talk."  Hm.  Maybe I do not go to many events and that has to change, but it was my first time seeing someone get shut down from participating.
