On March 5, during Big Data Week, I went to an event called Taking Open Data to the Streets.  It was all about the notion of 
trying to improve soil quality and accessing open data archives as well.  In addition, during the presentation, a speaker made a simple
Google survey form as a way to show us that it is easy to start going to the streets and have people record simple observations
of their soil.  The results can be aggregated into visual graphs etc.
