| 5      | [https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35511](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35511)                 | pull request FreeCodeCamp | I tried to get into the community by making a simple solution to a data structures question on adjacency lists in Javascript.                                                                                                  |
